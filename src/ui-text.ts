 * This is source-level customization, not a tui.json option or runtime override.
 * Model instructions live in prompts/ and contracts/. Model-written reports,
 * host-owned controls and technical diagnostic details are not interface copy.
 * Keep labels short: the review sidebar is 42 columns including padding.
